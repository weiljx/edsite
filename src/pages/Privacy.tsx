        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Sharing Personal Information with Third Party Sources</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We take care to allow your personal information to be accessed only by those who really need to in order to perform their tasks and duties, and to share with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. 1KPrime will never sell or rent your personal information.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We understand how important your privacy is, which is why 1KPrime maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

However, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Policy.
        </p>
