Format integers with US thousands separators (commas).

Goal
Convert any integer with four or more digits to include commas every three digits, while preserving surrounding context.

Rules
- Preserve any leading sign (+ or -), currency symbol ($, £, €, etc.), and whitespace.
- Preserve any trailing units, words, or punctuation (e.g., settlements, users, ms).
- Do not modify abbreviations or compact units such as 4B, 2.5M, 3k, 4bn.
- Do not alter decimals or fractional formatting (e.g., 1234.56 stays 1,234.56).
- Do not change numbers under 1,000.
- Apply consistently to all occurrences.

Examples
- 10000 -> 10,000
- +10000 -> +10,000
- $10000 -> $10,000
- 10000 settlements -> 10,000 settlements
- 1,000 -> 1,000 (no change)
- 4B -> 4B (no change)
